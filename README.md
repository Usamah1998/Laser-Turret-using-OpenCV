# Laser-Turret-using-OpenCV
A laser pointer turret that aims at and follows target objects within its view.The turret consists of a laser attached to two servo motors controlling horizontal and vertical aim. Uses a arduino to control the laser and a hand detection algorithm using OpenCV and cvzone. The center of the bounding box of the largest contour detected by OpenCV is used as the target for the laser to track.The algorithm can be configured to detect different objects using cvzone like face, shapes, colors and many other objects using cvzone library with OpenCV. It also calculate the distance of the object using which accurate angles is calculated for the X-Y servos.
## Implementation
### Calculating Focal Length
First the focal length of the camera must be calculated using a set of images. First we execute the script `Capture_ref_image.py` and a window pops up with camera feed. Then, we put our hand(or the target object) at a distance of exact `84cm` from the camera and take a series of pictures by pressing `c`. Which will be stored in a file `capture_images`. This known distance(84cm) can be changed in `Utils.py` by chanhing the value of variable `Known_distance`. The average known width of the hand from bottom of Index finger to Pinky finger is `6.3cm`. This Known width(6.3cm) can be changed in `Utils.py` by chanhing the value of variable `Known_width`. Using the formula:

              focal_length = (virtual_width * known_distance)/known_width
              
Where virtual width is calculated by OpenCV and known_distance, known_width is explained above. we find the focal length of the camera.To get more accurate focal length we find focal length for all images and take average of them. (This formulae is derived by using Ray optics and trignometry)
### Calculating Distance
Once the focal length is calculated we find distance of each detected object using the formulae:

              distance = (Known_width * focal_length)/virtual_width
 
 Where virtual width is calculated by OpenCV, focal length is calculated above and known width is also explained above.(This formulae is derived by using Ray optics concepts.)
 ### Calculating Angles
 First we find the distance of `center of object` from the `center of screen` for the both the axis using formulae:
 
              X_virtual = -(center_x - scrnCenter_x)
              Y_virtual = -(center_y - scrnCenter_y)
          
 After calculating the X and Y distance from the center of screen. Then, using trignometric formulae `tan Î¸ = Perpendicular / Base` for each axis. We find the angle of servos in Real Plane.
